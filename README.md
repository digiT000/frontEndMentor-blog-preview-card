## My process

In this learning experience, I tried building a website with a mobile-first approach. Since this is a Free+ challenge, it also provided the Figma file. Because of that, I could see the text and color styles.

So, first, I created classes for the text styles. Second, I used variables to define the colors that would be used. Then, I continued to create the HTML, define all the classes, and style it with CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

In this challenge, I continued to practice my HTML and CSS. From this challenge, I learned one new thing: you can affect other elements on hover.

I also learned to use variables in CSS for color styles. I find it easy to manage colors this way, and it makes bulk changes much easier.

### Continued development

Continue to practice my HTML and CSS before continue to the Javascript.
